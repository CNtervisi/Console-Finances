Declare variables to hold data:
- total number of months
- total profit/losses
- previous month profit/losses
- total change in profit/losses from previous month to current month
- greatest increase in profit/losses
- date of greatest increase
- greatest decrease in profit/losses
- date of greatest decrease

//Need to use a 'for' loop here to go over each month in fincances. 

Go through each month in finances:
- Get date and profit/losses for the month
- Increase total number of months by 1
- Add profit/losses to total profit/losses
If it's not the first month:
- Calculate change in profit/losses
- Add change to total change in profit/losses
If change is greater than greatest:
- Increase value then update greatest increase and its date
If change is less than greatest decrease:
- Update greatest decrease and its date
- Remember current profit/losses for the next month

Calculate average change in profit/losses
